#### Brief overview
lumimoon is dApp created to connect Substrate ecosystem with EVM ecosystem through Moonbeam. Users can transfer their assets through XCM messages to Moonbeam (By ParaSpell XCM SDK) and then use Axelar GMP passing to tranfer them from Moonbeam to EVM chains and vice versa. Simple concept which really works.
